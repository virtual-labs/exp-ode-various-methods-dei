### About the Experiment  

This experiment focuses on the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which frequently arise in scientific and engineering problems. The study includes the implementation of Euler’s method as a simple yet foundational approach and the more advanced Runge-Kutta methods for improved accuracy and stability. These techniques allow for the step-by-step approximation of solutions where exact analytical solutions may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Students gain practical understanding of convergence, local and global errors, and the comparative efficiency of different numerical schemes for solving initial value problems.
