### Procedure

1. **Select the Differential Equation**
   - Enter the differential equation in dy/dt format using ‘y’ as the dependent variable and ‘t’ as the independent variable.
   - Provide the initial condition by setting the initial time (t₀) and the initial value of the function (y₀).

2. **Set the Solver Parameters**
   - Specify the final time (tₙ) to define the interval for the solution.
   - Enter the number of steps to divide the interval into, which controls accuracy.

3. **Choose a Numerical Method**
   - Select **Euler’s Method** for a basic first-order approximation.
   - Select **4th Order Runge-Kutta Method** for higher accuracy using multiple slope evaluations.

4. **Run the Simulation**
   - Click on the **Simulate** button to compute the solution of the ODE.

5. **Analyze the Output**
   - Observe the numerical results displayed in the output section.
   - View the plotted graph to analyze how the solution evolves over time.
   - Repeat with different step sizes or methods to compare accuracy and stability.
